# CS308: Project

An OPG analyzer and convolution optimization based on TVM.

You may find the report in `report` by running `make` under the folder.

All files, except `conv2d.py` is a part of the OPG analyzer, and in `conv2d.py` is the convolution optimization, which is in the `schedule()` function.

This is a teamwork, done by JIANG Weihao and LI Zhidan. Both of them contributed equally to this project.
